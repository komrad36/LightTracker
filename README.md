Three mutually orthogonal ambient light sensors mounted on a pair of orthogonal gimbals allow an Arduino to track a light source unambiguously anywhere in the positive hemisphere.

Inverse kinematics are used to solve even the case in which it is unable to point directly at the light and instead will seamlessly face the opposite direction and flip over onto its back using the vertical gimbal to point upside-down at the light source.

Serial output shows some of the work being performed, as in this example:
